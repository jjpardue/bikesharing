# NYC Citibike Challenge

The purpose of this challenge was to create visualizations using Tableau for a mock investor presentation. The idea was to recreate a city-wide bike sharing program that was proven successful in New York and bring it to Des Moines, Iowa.

I enjoyed the challenge and creative aspect of taking data and making it understandable and presentable to a new audience. 

It is my personal belief that comparing the two markets - New York City vs. Des Moines - may not have been the best comparison due to a few factors: 
  - Population
  - Weather
  - Commuter-friendly city 

Alas, the data is interesting and not surprising when you learn that the highest traffic times and days are that of commuters; those using the bike sharing program to get to and from work with the duration of most trips being 5-6 minutes.

Interestingly, males tend to use the bikes in NYC more often during the weekday and hold the title of most "subscribers".

It would be interesting to compare more data and might I suggest another city to pull from (i.e. Minneapolis, Chicago, or another midwest metro location).
